                <h2>Characters</h2>
                <p>
                    The characters in Undertale are a crucial part of the game's charm and appeal. Each character has a unique personality, backstory, and set of motivations that add depth and complexity to the game's world. Certain
                    characters genders are left purposely unidentifiable to allow players to relate more easily, leaving it to their imagination.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The characters in Undertale are more than just colorful personalities; they also play an important role in the game's narrative and themes. Many of the characters have their own story arcs and struggles, and the player's
                    interactions with them can have a significant impact on the game's outcome. The game's emphasis on empathy and compassion is reflected in the way the characters are portrayed, with many of them representing different
                    facets of humanity and the human experience.
                </p>
                <p>Since this is just a fan page, only the ones I find most notable will be listed. It would be appreciated if you read them:</p>
                <h3>Frisk</h3>
                <a href="https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Toriel" target="_blank"><img src="images/FriskTorielArt.png" width="80%" alt="" /></a>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    At the center of the game's story is Frisk, the player character, who serves as the player's avatar in the game. Frisk is a human child who has fallen into the underground world of monsters after tripping on a vine at
                    the top of Mt. Ebott and must find their way back to the surface. Throughout the game, Frisk interacts with a diverse cast of characters, including monsters, humans, and even ghosts. The player is later informed that the
                    barrier requires 7 human SOULs to break the barrier at the end to set the monsters free. Frisk's gender is unidentifiable.
                </p>

                <h3>Chara</h3>
                <a href="https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Chara" target="_blank"><img src="images/CharaAsriel.jpg" width="80%" alt="" /></a>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    Chara is a person referred to in the game as the first human, the one who fell before any other. He (gender unidentifiable) was treated kindly by the family of the King and Queen of the underworld and was included like
                    family, befriending Asriel. <br>
                    <br>

                    Overtime, Chara finds out that his SOUL has the power to break the barrier, but only as long as he merged it with a monster SOUL. Chara ends up merging his soul with Asriel and steps through the barrier, only to be
                    inflicted trauma by the humans' instant disgust towards seeing a monster. Asriel is nearly killed and barely makes it back into the underworld, where they end up dying. <br>
                    <br>

                    Chara grows a strong resentment towards Asriel as the one who controled the merged body to not fight back before they both die. Upon Chara's awakening as a ghost that follows the player around, he claims that the
                    player's DETERMINATION woke him up. Chara theorized to be the narrator of interactable objects within the game.
                </p>

                <h3>Sans</h3>
                <a href="https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Sans" target="_blank"><img src="images/Sans_artwork_Steam_card.png" width="80%" alt="" /></a>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    One of the most memorable characters in Undertale is Sans, a lazy and pun-loving skeleton who serves as a guide and mentor to Frisk. Sans is known for his laid-back attitude and mysterious powers, as well as his love of
                    pranks and jokes. The interaction between Sans and his brother Papyrus who hates puns is a great comedical point of the game, unwitnessable on the <a href="GenocideRoute.html">Genocide Route</a>. <br>
                    <br>
                </p>

                <h3>Papyrus</h3>
                <a href="https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Papyrus" target="_blank"><img src="images/Papyrusofc.jpeg" width="80%" alt="" /></a>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    Another memorable character is Papyrus, Sans' energetic and optimistic brother. Papyrus is a self-proclaimed "great" warrior who dreams of capturing a human and becoming a member of the royal guard. Despite his
                    enthusiasm, Papyrus is also a kind and empathetic character, who often tries to see the best in others. He never loses trust in the player to be kind, even upon his death.
                </p>

                <h3>Flowey</h3>
                <a href="https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Flowey" target="_blank"><img src="images/OMEGAFloweyArt.png" width="80%" alt="" /></a>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    The little flower tries to greet unsuspecting humans who fall down to steal their souls, with the goal of replacing his nonexistant one upon his death. He follows the player arround and can be seen for 5 frames when the
                    player backtracks the game at certain points. Flowey is the soulless form of Asriel, almost a entirely different person after waiting for years. <br>
                    <br>

                    Upon stealing the 6 previously fallen human souls and substituting the final 7th soul with every single monster's soul in the underworld combined, Flowey transforms into OMEGA Flowey. The player goes through a really
                    hard boss fight and is later retaliated against by the human souls flowey absorbed.
                </p>

                <h3>Toriel</h3>
                <a href="https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Toriel" target="_blank"><img src="images/TorielArtwork.jpg" width="80%" alt="" /></a>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    One of the game creator's main inspirational point of the game was to create a character which genuinely treated the player like her own child. He criticized many other games for having the only purpose of their mother
                    being to send the player off on their journey. In the game, the player is deperately pleaded by Toriel to stay with her after having saw the other 6 humans leave and killed.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h4>AUs</h4>
                <p>Overtime, the fanbase has developed an insane array of alternate universes where characters have different backgrounds and stories, all in their own imaginative style and imagination.</p>

                <a href="https://undertale-au.fandom.com/wiki/Undertale_AU_Wiki" target="_blank"><img src="images/AuArt.png" width="80%" alt="" /> </a>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    Overall, the characters in Undertale are a testament to the game's storytelling and world-building. They are memorable, relatable, and add depth and complexity to the game's themes and message. Whether players choose to
                    take the pacifist or genocide route, the characters in Undertale will stay with them long after the game is over.
                </p>
