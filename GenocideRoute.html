                <h2>Genocide Route</h2>
                <p>
                    The genocide route is a playthrough in which the player character, Frisk, intentionally kills every monster they encounter. This route is the opposite of the pacifist route, which encourages non-violent solutions to
                    problems and empathy towards monsters. The genocide route is characterized by a sense of brutality and despair, as the player becomes more and more detached from the consequences of their actions. The route also has a
                    different ending than the pacifist route, with a darker and more nihilistic tone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The genocide route is unlocked by killing a certain number of monsters in the game. Once the player has killed enough monsters, the game's tone and mechanics change, with more difficult enemies and a sense of dread and
                    foreboding. The player is encouraged to continue killing monsters, even as the game becomes more difficult and the consequences of their actions become more apparent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The genocide route is often described as a commentary on the nature of violence in video games and the desensitization that can occur when players are encouraged to kill without consequences. The route is intentionally
                    difficult and emotionally draining, with the game's characters commenting on the player's actions and expressing their fear and despair. The game also features a final boss fight that is considered one of the most
                    difficult and emotionally impactful in gaming history.
                </p>

                    Overall, the genocide route is a stark contrast to the pacifist route and is designed to challenge players' assumptions about the role of violence in video games. While it is possible to complete the gameon the genocide
                    route, the experience is often considered unsatisfying and disturbing, as the player is forced to confront the consequences of their actions and the toll that violence can take on oneself and others. The game ultimately
                    suggests that there is a cost to pursuing power at any cost, and that empathy and compassion are necessary for true fulfillment and happiness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is worth noting that Undertale encourages players to make their own choices and play the game in a way that feels true to their own values. While the genocide route is a valid way to play the game, it is not the only
                    way, and the pacifist route is often considered to be the "true" ending of the game. The game's themes of empathy, compassion, and non-violence are emphasized throughout both routes, and players are encouraged to think
                    critically about their own actions and the impact they have on others.
